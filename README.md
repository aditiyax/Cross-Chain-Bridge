# Cross-Chain Bridge: ETH ⇄ SOL Token Swap

A simple and efficient **Cross-Chain Bridge** using a relayer mechanism to enable token swaps between **Ethereum (ETH)** and **Solana (SOL)** blockchains. This project bridges the gap between two distinct ecosystems, allowing users to transfer assets seamlessly across chains.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Token Swapping**: Enables swapping of tokens from ETH to SOL and vice versa with minimal overhead.
- **Relayer Mechanism**: A decentralized intermediary ensures secure and reliable transaction relay between chains.
- **Interoperability**: Bridges the gap between Ethereum’s EVM and Solana’s high-performance blockchain.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized to minimize gas fees and transaction costs.

## 🛠 How It Works

1. **User Initiates Swap**: 
   - On the Ethereum or Solana side, the user sends their tokens to a **smart contract**.
2. **Relayer Notifies Counterparty**: 
   - The relayer monitors blockchain events and triggers a corresponding transaction on the target chain.
3. **Tokens Released/Minted**:
   - On the target chain, equivalent tokens are either **minted** (wrapped assets) or **released** (from liquidity pools).
4. **Completion**: 
   - The user receives the swapped tokens on the destination blockchain.

## 🤔 Why Use a Cross-Chain Bridge?

- **Expand Utility**: Move your assets to the ecosystem where they are most effective.
- **Arbitrage Opportunities**: Leverage price differences across chains for profit.
- **Liquidity Access**: Interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on both Ethereum and Solana without converting to fiat.

---

## 🚀 Use Cases

- **DeFi**: Swap tokens to access liquidity pools or yield farming on either chain.
- **Gaming**: Transfer assets like NFTs or in-game tokens across blockchains.
- **Payments**: Enable cross-chain payments with lower fees and faster settlements.

## 📝 Requirements

- **Environment**:
  - Ethereum Smart Contracts (e.g., Solidity).
  - Solana Programs (e.g., Rust).
- **Relayer Setup**:
  - A service to listen for events and facilitate token transfers.
- **Token Standards**:
  - ERC-20 for Ethereum.
  - SPL Token for Solana.

## 🔧 Quick Start

1. Deploy the smart contracts on Ethereum and Solana.
2. Configure the relayer service to listen for events and execute transactions.
3. Interact with the system via the provided interface or API.

## 🌍 Future Enhancements

- Support for additional blockchains.
- Enhanced relayer decentralization.
- Better liquidity management for direct swaps.
